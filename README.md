#What is The Reported?

The Reported is an unfunded civilian-led project by three researchers working to record comprehensive information on police-involved deaths in Canada as a result of use-of-force or failing to provide the necessaries of life. The Reported aims to capture information about each individual incident, the demographics of the deceased, and the story of how they died. This information has been rendered as an [interactive map](http://thereported.ca/#map), as well as a [comprehensive database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r-e6lWoVLSagRk7zfp_TNkgVrhRTtVe2QoYUwOrAeKI/edit?usp=sharing).

Information gathered by our researchers has been culled from media coverage, statements from law enforcement organizations, reports from police watchdogs, social media tributes, photos, and obituaries. We welcome verifiable crowdsourced information, including new submissions, contributions of missing information, updates, and edits, from the public to enhance the quality of our data. We understand that The Reported is a work in progress, and that information may be missing or incomplete.

##Why is it Important?

No organization in Canada maintains reliable, comprehensive national records of police-involved deaths. Information that is recorded is done so piecemeal by provincial police watchdogs, such as Ontario's SIU and Alberta's ASIRT, or by law enforcement organizations themselves. However, not all demographic information is recorded, including information on race/ethnicity and the presence of mental health barriers.

In the interest of greater accountability to the public, The Reported aims to address this missing demographic information and assemble a detailed national picture of police-involved fatalities as a result of use-of-force or failing to provide the necessaries of life.

##What Information is Included?

Currently, The Reported only includes deaths through interactions with civilians as a result of use of force or failing to provide the necessaries of life. This includes, but is not limited to, police shooting civilians, deploying CEWs (tasers), use of blunt force, and failing to intervene in a suicide. At present, it does not include deaths that occur in custody and while incarcerated, or as a result of vehicular accidents or vehicular pursuits. These may be added to The Reported in time.

As well, we have only documented deaths to the best of our ability beginning in 2013. However, our intention is to continue recording police-involved deaths in Canada regardless of year. That said, our onus is to prioritize our research to record recent incidents, i.e. within the past 5 years.

To the best of our ability, which we realize is often a judgment call on the part of The Reported's researchers, we aim to describe the race/ethnicity of the deceased. If you know this information to be incorrect or have details about this information where missing, please contact us at _info@thereported.ca_. Labelling of race/ethnicity is derived from categories used by Statistics Canada on the [2011 National Housing Survey](http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=PR&Code1=01&Data=Count&SearchText=Canada&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&A1=All&B1=All&Custom=&TABID=1), with two notable exceptions. That is, because of the imprecise nature of the methodology used to determine race/ethnicity, the NHS categories of Chinese, Korean, and Japanese are merged into a single category, Asian. As well, individuals of Mixed Race identity are explicitly defined as such, with details of their background stated. Whenever possible, the specific nationality of an individual will be recorded, particularly for individuals of Aboriginal heritage.

We also aim to detail the presence of mental health factors in the deceased prior to or at the time of their death, including distress, acts of self-harm, diagnoses, and accounts by relatives and friends. This category may also occasionally detail other barriers, such as homelessness or the presence of drugs or alcohol at the time of death. This information may be revised to stand alone as a separate category.

In some cases, information on an incident is only available in French-language reports.

###What Information is Not Included?

Individuals whose deaths have been verified to be self-inflicted are generally not included The Reported. If this information is contentious, _the entry will be colour-coded in yellow, as opposed to red_, indicating that it has not been confirmed if the death was a result of suicide. If a death, including a suicide, occurs as the result of a failure on the part of a police officer to provide the necessaries of life, _the entry will be colour-coded in grey_.

###How are "Armed" or "Unarmed" Defined?

The deceased is recorded as "Armed" if they are in possession of a firearm, bladed weapon (i.e. a knife), explosive device, any other instrument that could reasonably be used to inflict harm, e.g. a chainsaw or pipe, or are driving a vehicle with intention to cause harm. The deceased is recorded as "Unarmed" if they are not in possession of any items that could be utilized as a weapon, are in possession of a replica firearm or BB gun, or are in a vehicle where there is no indication that they intend to use it to cause harm. Occasionally, there will be a note of "Unconfirmed" or "Alleged" next to this information if the deceased's status as "Armed" or "Unarmed" has not been verified or is contentious.
